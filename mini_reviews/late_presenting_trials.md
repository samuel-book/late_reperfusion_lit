# Trials on use of thrombectomy or thrombolysis in late-presenting stroke

Several significant trials have investigated late-presenting stroke treatment with thrombectomy or thrombolysis:

## Major Clinical Trials

**DAWN and DEFUSE 3**

These pioneering trials established the foundation for late window treatment, enabling mechanical thrombectomy up to 24 hours for selected patients [4].

**CLEAR Study**

A multicenter retrospective study across 20 centers in 10 countries between 2014-2022, examining 2,749 patients with anterior circulation large vessel occlusion presenting 6-24 hours after last known well
[9].

**POST-TNK Trial**

Currently ongoing trial investigating intra-arterial tenecteplase after successful endovascular thrombectomy in patients presenting within 24 hours of symptom onset [12].

**TIMELESS Trial**

Phase III trial investigating tenecteplase efficacy in the extended time window from 4.5 to 24 hours [4].

## Recent Meta-Analyses

**2024 Meta-Analysis**

Analysis of 10 randomized clinical trials including 2,824 patients comparing endovascular thrombectomy plus best medical treatment versus best medical treatment alone in patients presenting beyond 6 hours [7].

**Florida Stroke Registry Analysis**

Large registry study of 5,702 endovascular thrombectomy patients, with 1,580 (28%) being late presenters (6-24 hours), demonstrating comparable safety outcomes between early and late treatment groups [14].

## Key Findings

- Approximately 15% of admitted UK stroke patients are now eligible for thrombectomy [5].
- Late-presenting patients with large core strokes showed greater benefits from thrombectomy compared to those with non-large core strokes [7].
- Patient selection using perfusion imaging in the late time window (6-24 hours) has been associated with improved functional outcomes [15].
