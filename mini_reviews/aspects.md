# ASPECTS (Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score) 

ASPECTS (Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score) is a 10-point quantitative scoring system used to assess early ischemic changes in stroke patients[1][4]. 

## Key Components
- Initial score starts at 10 (normal) and points are deducted for each affected region
- Evaluates specific regions in the middle cerebral artery (MCA) territory:
  
**Subcortical Structures**
- Caudate nucleus
- Lentiform nucleus 
- Internal capsule
- Insular cortex[6]

**Cortical Regions (M1-M6)**
- M1: Anterior MCA cortex (frontal operculum)
- M2: MCA cortex lateral to insular ribbon
- M3: Posterior MCA cortex
- M4-M6: Superior territories[1]

## Clinical Significance

The score serves multiple important purposes:
- Predicts functional outcomes in stroke patients
- Guides treatment decisions for mechanical thrombectomy
- Helps assess eligibility for interventional treatments[3]

**Key Thresholds:**
- ASPECTS ≥8: Higher chance for independent outcome
- ASPECTS ≤7: Predicts worse functional outcome at 3 months
- ASPECTS ≤4: Poor response to intravascular treatment[4]

## Variations

**PC-ASPECTS:** A modified version for posterior circulation strokes that evaluates:
- Thalami (1 point each)
- Midbrain (2 points)
- Pons (2 points)
- Cerebellar hemispheres (1 point each)
- Occipital lobes (1 point each)[1]

ASPECTS can be assessed using different imaging modalities:
- Non-contrast CT
- CT perfusion
- CTA source images[6]
