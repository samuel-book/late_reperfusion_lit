# What is large core ischaemic stroke

A large-core ischemic stroke occurs when there is a significant blockage in blood supply to a large area of the brain, resulting in extensive brain tissue death. This condition is specifically characterized by:

## Key Characteristics

**Size Definition**
- Typically defined as an ischemic core volume of ≥70 mL[2]
- Can be measured using the Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score (ASPECTS) of ≤5[1]

**Affected Areas**
- Usually involves major brain arteries or branch cortical arteries[8]
- Can affect areas controlling critical functions like movement, speech, and sensation[3]

## Clinical Presentation

**Common Symptoms**
- Sudden onset of neurological deficits[6]
- Inability to move or feel on one side of the body
- Problems with understanding or speaking
- Visual field deficits
- Dizziness[3]

## Treatment Options

**Endovascular Thrombectomy (EVT)**
- Recent evidence supports the use of EVT for large-core strokes[4]
- Most effective for core volumes between 70-100 mL[2]
- Can double the rate of good functional outcomes compared to medical management alone[7]

## Outcomes

**Prognosis Factors**
- Successful recanalization is the strongest predictor of good outcomes[1]
- Baseline diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) lesional volume significantly impacts recovery[1]
- Age and presence of diabetes mellitus can affect mortality rates[1]

The management of large-core ischemic strokes has evolved significantly, with new evidence supporting more aggressive treatment approaches, particularly in selected patients who previously might have been considered unsuitable for intervention[9].
