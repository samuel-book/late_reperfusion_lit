[2] Protocol

## Patient selection

* The trial focused on patients with acute a large vessel ischemic stroke caused by a blockage in the internal carotid artery (ICA) or middle cerebral artery (MCA).

* NIHSS >= 6

* Modified Rankin Scale less than or equal to 2 prior to qualifying stroke

* Time window: Patients had to be treated within 6 to 16 hours of when they were last known to be well.

* Perfusion imaging (CT Perfusion or MR Perfusion) assess blood flow in brain. Patients were selected based on having significant salvageable tissue, indicated the presence of an ischemic penumbra around a small core. The penumbra is tissue at risk of damage but still potentially salvageable.
  * Target Mismatch Profile on CT perfusion or MRI (ischemic core volume is <70 ml, mismatch ratio is at least 1.8 and mismatch volume is at least 15 ml)
  
* Exclude treated with tPA >4.5 h after time last known well (or > 3hrs for age 80+)

* Exclude ASPECTS < 6

## Key results

Paper [1] describes results for treated patients according to level of reperfusion achieved.

* Effectiveness analysed by level of reperfusion achieved, using the Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction (TICI) scale:
  * 0: No Perfusion
  * 1: Minimal Perfusion
  * 2a: Partial Perfusion (<50% perfusion of the artery and its main branches)
  * 2b: Partial Perfusion (>50% perfusion of the artery and its main branches)
  * Complete Perfusion
  
Improved modified rankin scale was associated with greater levels of reperfusion.
