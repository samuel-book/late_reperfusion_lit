# Glossary

* **ASPECTS (Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score)**: a 10-point quantitative scoring system used to assess early ischaemic changes in stroke patients. It is related to the number of regions affected by the stroke and correlates with the size of the core of stroke (though as the number of affected areas increases, the ASPECTS score reduces). 

* **Core**: The core of the stroke is the area of brain considered likely irretrievably damaged by the stroke. As time progresses the core grows.

* **Penumbra**: The area of likely salvageable brain around the ischaemic core. The penumbra is likely to be saved by successful reperfusion. As time progresses the penumbra shrinks (being replaced by unsalvageable core).
