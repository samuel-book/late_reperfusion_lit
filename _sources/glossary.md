# Glossary

* **ASPECTS (Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score)**: a 10-point quantitative scoring system used to assess early ischaemic changes in stroke patients. It correlates with the size of the core of stroke (though as the core grows, the ASPECTS score reduces). It is uses to predict outcome and assess suitability for thrombectomy.

* **Core**: The core of the stroke is the area of brain considered likely irretrievably damaged by the stroke. As time progresses the core grows.
